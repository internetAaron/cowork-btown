      <h2>About us</h2>
       <p>Welcome to the workplace of the future!  Cowork Btown offers affordable workspace and exciting social events for professionals of all sorts â€“ right in the heart of downtown Bloomington. Although the space encourages collaboration, Cowork Btown is not just for entrepreneurs. The organization attempts to leverage the flexibility of the new working world, gathering likeminded small businesses, contractors and remote workers that love (and hope to keep their talents in) Bloomington.</p>
       
       <p>We are located in the beautiful town of Bloomington, IN.  We just moved into our space, a historic building just a couple blocks south of the square!  Our space has two large open work areas.  The front is more casual and can easily go from work environment to event space.  The back area is a more traditional desk area but still an open work environment.  We have two meeting rooms.  One is more traditional with a conference table and whiteboard.  The other is more casual and great for small meetings or phone calls.  If you'd like to visit us feel free to drop by during normal work hours through the week or keep an eye out for one of our events.</p>
