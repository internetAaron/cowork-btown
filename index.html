	     <h1>Work is so much better with awesome coworkers</h1>

	     <p>We're Yellow, a team made up of several of Bloomington's most talented designers, developers, and business experts — all of which have different areas of expertise and professional backgrounds. Because each project is assigned a custom team, co-op members avoid everyday monotonies and elicit each other’s creative skills. This allows Yellow to produce the best products and happiest clients anywhere.</p>

	     <p>We are always looking for awesome people to work with so if we have space we rent desk space.  You don't have to be employed by Yellow to work here.  If you would be interested in renting a desk fill out our application and we'll get back with you to see if you would be a good fit and if we have space for you.</p>

	     <h2>Where is Cowork Btown?</h2>
	     
	     <p>We are located in the beautiful town of Bloomington, IN.  We are moving into a space in the very near future.  We'll have more detials on this very soon.</p>
