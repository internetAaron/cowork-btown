	  	<h2>About us</h2>
	     <p>Welcome to the workplace of the future!  Cowork Btown offers affordable workspace and exciting social events for professionals of all sorts – right in the heart of downtown Bloomington. Although the space encourages collaboration, Cowork Btown is not just for entrepreneurs. The organization attempts to leverage the flexibility of the new working world, gathering likeminded small businesses, artists, musicians, and remote workers that love (and hope to keep their talents in) Bloomington.</p>
 
			<p>Current coworkers range between 22 and 43 years old and include Bloomington natives, one-time residents of other Midwestern states, and migrants from both coasts. All coworkers take their work very seriously and are expected to respect the time and space of others, but their office hours vary drastically.</p>
			 
			<p>Cowork Btown is currently located at 117 West 6th Street, just across from Pheonix Comics. There are a limited number of dedicated desks still available and abundant “drop-in” workspaces.</p>

Drop-ins are invited to hangout at the space up to 15 hours each week, may attend all after hours events, and are able to rent the conference room twice per month. Sorry, no key, but doors are open from 8:00 AM to 7:00 PM most days.</p>

	           	<p>Interested in additional meeting space for your team? Access to a pipeline of local talent? Consider a corporate sponsorship. A donation of $595 gives your company monthly access to our conference room, a logo on the website, and access to the office bulletin board. Larger donations usually mean more access, but are handled on a case-by-case basis.</p>
