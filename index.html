	  	<h2>About us</h2>
	     <p>Welcome to the workplace of the future!  Cowork Btown offers affordable workspace and exciting social events for professionals of all sorts – right in the heart of downtown Bloomington. Although the space encourages collaboration, Cowork Btown is not just for entrepreneurs. The organization attempts to leverage the flexibility of the new working world, gathering likeminded small businesses, artists, musicians, and remote workers that love (and hope to keep their talents in) Bloomington.</p>
 
			<p>Current coworkers range between 22 and 43 years old and include Bloomington natives, one-time residents of other Midwestern states, and migrants from both coasts. All coworkers take their work very seriously and are expected to respect the time and space of others, but their office hours vary drastically.</p>
	     
	     <p>We are located in the beautiful town of Bloomington, IN.  We just moved into our space not even a block off the square!  Our space has a large open working area with several dedicated desk and drop in work stations.  We have two meeting rooms.  One is more traditional with a conference table and whiteboard.  The other is more casual with comfortable seating and a TV.  If you'd like to visit us feel free to drop by during normal work hours through the week or keep an eye out for one of our open events.</p>

A donation of $595 gives your company monthly access to our conference room, a logo on the website, and access to the office bulletin board. Larger donations usually mean more access, but are handled on a case-by-case basis.</p>
