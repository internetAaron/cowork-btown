      <h3>Night O'wl (St. Patricks Day Edition)<br> <span class="kicker">Monday, March 17th, 7p - 11p</span></h3>
      <p>This St. Patricks Day edition of Night Owl will be a Bloomington love fest. We're kicking off a project to create a site to share why we love life in Bloomington with a Night Owl hackathon! Anyone who loves Bloomington will be able to contribute.</p>
      <p>You can also just stop by to geek out, see the space and visit with some like minded people. Cowork Btown will have beer, snacks, music, and camaraderie. Take the opportunity to share what youâ€™ve been working on or join the hackathon.</p>

      <p>Come and stay the whole time or just drop in to say hello.</p>
